# Stack - How does it work?

Stacks follow the Last-in-First-Out ([LIFO](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO)) principle.

***e.g.*** As if stacking coins one one top of the other, the last coin we put on the top is the one that is the first to be removed from stack later.

I have created a data structure in cpp for a stack able to do the following methods:

- `push(item)` - Add an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop()` - Remove the top item from the stack.
- `peek()` - Returns a copy of the top item in the stack.
- `isEmpty()` - Return a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
- `size()` - Return the number of items in the stack.

I've also tryed to develop a fancy CLI interface to insert the intructions directly from the user :)
