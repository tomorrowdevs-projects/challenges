# The Queue Data Structure

## Easy version

Your task is to create a data structure for a queue. Implement a `Queue` class that supports the following methods:

  - `enqueue(item)` - adds an item to the queue
  - `dequeue()` - removes an item from the queue (FIFO)
  - `peek()` - returns the next item in the queue without removing it
  - `isEmpty()` - tests to see whether the queue is empty
  - `size()` - returns the number of items in the queue

You can use any programming language of your choice.

When committing your solution, make sure to write a README.md file explaining when it is helpful to use a queue and how it differs from a stack.

## Hard version

If you want a more challenging version, you can implement a stack in one of the following programming languages:

- C
- C++
- C#
- D
- Elixir
- Erlang
- OCaml
- Haskell
- F#
- Scala
- Java
- Kotlin
- Clojure
- Swift
