# Queue - How does it work?

Queues follow the First-in-First-Out ([FIFO](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO)) principle.

***e.g.*** As if waiting in a queue for the movie tickets, the first one to stand in line is the first one to buy a ticket and enjoy the movie.

I have created a data structure in cpp for a queue able to do the following methods:

  - `enqueue(item)` - adds an item to the queue
  - `dequeue()` - removes an item from the queue (FIFO)
  - `peek()` - returns the next item in the queue without removing it
  - `isEmpty()` - tests to see whether the queue is empty
  - `size()` - returns the number of items in the queue
  - `isFull()` - tests to see whether the queue is full
  - `display()` - return the item inside the queue

  
  I've also tryed to develop a fancy CLI interface to insert the intructions directly from the user :)
